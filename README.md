o	The system continues to evolve, enabling Amazon to remain agile and adapt to new challenges.


c.1. Company Overview
Operating one of the most complex supply chain networks in the world, Amazon is a global leader in e-commerce, cloud computing, and logistics. To become more efficient and competitive, Amazon sought to deploy an Enterprise system that would provide for better inventory control, more streamlined internal processes, and operational efficiency. It aimed to help the company with problems like inventory handling, fulfillment, and scalability with peak operations and improved efficiency. In fact, this enterprise system implementation had many challenges and failed, even though Amazon has ample resources and experience.
c.2. Implementation Process & Challenges
	That meant an overhaul migration to a new, cutting-edge enterprise system built to support Amazon’s global footprint. And it came in phases: system design; data migration; testing and training. But there were early hiccups in this process:
	Technical Challenges in Real World: Operational Complexity: One may argue that, Amazon is one of the most complex inter-Dependent systems of enterprise in the world that addex exponentially to enterprise solution deployment challenge. It would create a colossal disruption of the worst proportions, there was absolutely nothing in between the existing processes and the new system.
	Inaccurate Data Migration: In various instances, the data will likewise incorporate stock information, customer data, etc as large chunks of data which would now go to the ERP design which leads to false information which drives to misstatements in the organization, and this in further data generates a legacy request fulfillment mistake in the organization.
	Adoption Issues: The employees resisted the changes and it soon turned out to be an extreme frustration on their end and was hindering their productivity associated with the lucid system.
	Vendor Mismatch The winning vendor lacked an understanding of Amazon’s business that was sufficient to build a system that would be able to adjust to changes in demand in real time.
	Timeline: The quick rollout didn’t allow much time to smooth out unexpected tech headaches, or to adjust the system architecture.
